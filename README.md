# Bogosort Simulation
 Simulates Bogosort Algorithm

This was made in a limited version of Racket made by a computer science professor at Northwestern
As such, it may not work properly when run with full Racket

The randomizing algorithm is also very inefficient due to me not having access to much Racket functionality
