# Bogosort Simulation
 Simulates Bogosort Algorithm

This was done in a limited version of Racket as part of CS_111 at Northwestern
As such, it may not work properly when run with full Racket

The randomizing algorithm is also very inefficient due to me not having access to much Racket functionality
